Really simple fullstack project with React-Node.js-Firebase(db)

This project was a really fast timed boot camp to rasp the basic knowledge of React js technologies (Webpack,Babel,etc.) and to develop a simple fullstack environment that uses REST commands to edit data in a database.
The target was also to deploy the fullstack project to some SaaP and the chosen one was Google Cloud. Database is handled by Firebase (also by Google).
I grasped the basic aspects of React & Typescript & Webpack & Babel ...etc. to be able to build a React frontend that uses Node.js backend to communicate with the database.
Google Cloud was also a new area for me and it took some try&error to get things running in there.

The really basic frontend can be used from:
